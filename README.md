# Downer

Downer is [yet](http://sharejs.org/) [another](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite) realtime collaborative text editor implemented in node.js.  I created it for my own use because the other available options seemed unnecessarily complicated or made some assumptions I wasn't comfortable with.

This project does very little and mostly borrows from existing projects for all heavy lifting.

# Installing and running

    git clone git@github.com:tizzo/downer.git
    npm install
    PORT=3000 npm start
